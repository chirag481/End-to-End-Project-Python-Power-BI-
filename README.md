# Introduction

A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.

# Objectives

-Visuals Depicting the Number of Bird Strikes 

-Yearly Analysis Total Struct By Wildlife: Size

-Total Struct By Sky-Conditions 

-Total Struct By Origin State 

-Average Feet above the Ground Of Bird-Strike 

-Total Person Injured 

-Top 10 US Airlines in terms of having encountered bird strikes 

-Airports with most incidents of bird strikes(Top 50) 

-Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikes 

-When do most bird strikes occur? 

-Altitude of airplanes at the time of strike 

-Phase of flight at the time of strike Average 

-Altitude of the airplanes in different phases at the time of strike Effect of Bird Strikes 

-Impact on Flight Effect of Strike at Different Altitude 

-Were Pilots Informed? 

-Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation

# Conclusions

47.40% incidents happended when sky condition was no cloud 

42.72% incidents where pilot was warned about the birds

Prior warning to the pilot reduces the risk of damage to the aircraft

75.80% of incidents have happened due to some small unknown bird.

90.31% incidents caused no damage while 9.69% incidents caused damage

87% of bird strike incidents have happened when the altitude of airplane was <1000 ft and 13% have happened when altitude was >1000 ft.
